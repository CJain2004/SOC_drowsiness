Over the course of three weeks, I have delved into various fundamental concepts in the field of machine learning. Initially, I explored the realm of supervised learning, a technique where a model learns from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Within this domain, I acquired knowledge about linear regression, a method used to establish relationships between input variables and continuous output values. This allowed me to understand how to predict numerical outcomes based on given data.

Building upon this foundation, I then delved into classification algorithms, which aim to assign data points to specific categories or classes. These algorithms enable us to make decisions based on available information. I also delved into the concept of gradient descent, a powerful optimization algorithm used to iteratively refine models by minimizing errors or maximizing performance.

Furthermore, I explored the fascinating world of neural networks. I gained insights into the workings of these interconnected networks of artificial neurons, which mimic the human brain's structure and enable machines to learn from vast amounts of data. I learned about their significance in solving complex problems, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, and image classification.

Lastly, I dived into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized type of neural network primarily designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images. CNNs employ convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to automatically extract features from images and make accurate predictions or classifications.

Through these three weeks of study, I have acquired a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of machine learning, supervised learning, linear regression, classification, gradient descent, neural networks, and CNNs. I am now equipped with a versatile toolkit that will enable me to explore and tackle a wide range of real-world problems using machine learning techniques.
